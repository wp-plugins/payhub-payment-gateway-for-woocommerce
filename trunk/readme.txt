== Notes on Security ==
This plugin requires validation of the host SSL certificate for PayHub servers.  This is important as it greatly reduces the chance of a successful "man in the middle" attack.

If you go through the installation and everything works fine, then you don't have to worry about the rest of this section.  If you are experiencing a problem where you receive a blank error when trying to process cards and the transaction never actually processes then read on...

Since our plugin uses cURL (http://curl.haxx.se/) to send transaction requests, you need to make sure that cURL knows where to find the CA certificate with which to validate our API SSL certs.  This is generally not a problem with hosted setups, but if you have built out your own server then you may find that this is a problem because newer versions of cURL don't include a CA bundle by default.  In this case, if you are using PHP 5.3.7 or greater you can:

*download http://curl.haxx.se/ca/cacert.pem and save it somewhere on your server.
*update php.ini -- add curl.cainfo = "PATH_TO/cacert.pem"

This solutions was shamelessly borrowed from the Stack Overflow post: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6400300/php-curl-https-causing-exception-ssl-certificate-problem-verify-that-the-ca-cer.  Gotta love Stack Overflow ;^).

Alternitively, you can dig into the PayHub plugin itself and add the following key/value pair to the $c_opts array: CURLOPT_CAINFO => "payth/to/ca-bundle.pem".  See http://us2.php.net/manual/en/book.curl.php for more info.
